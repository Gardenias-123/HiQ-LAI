# HiQ-LAI

The High-Quality Leaf Area Index (HiQ-LAI) is derived from reprocessed MODIS LAI C6.1 product by SpatioTemporal Information Compositing Algorithm (STICA). This method integrates information from multiple dimensions, including pixel quality information, spatiotemporal correlation, and original observations, to improve the raw MODIS LAI retrievals with poor quality. The HiQ-LAI covers the period from 2000 to 2022 year, with spatial resolutions of 500m/5km for global vegetation area and temporal resolutions of 8 days.

The HiQ-LAI product file name follows certain naming convention, providing useful information about a specific product. More details can found in DataDescriptionForHiQLAI.docx, and data read examples can also be viewed in this file.
